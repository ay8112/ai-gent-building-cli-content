cd ai-gent-building-cli-content
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Initialize a new agent
python cli/main.py init-agent --name "ContentBot"

# Generate content using a prompt
python cli/main.py generate --agent "ContentBot" --prompt "Write a blog post about AI agents"

# Export results
python cli/main.py export --format markdown
Absolutely, Aman. Here's a professional and modular README.md draft tailored for the  repo. It assumes the project is a CLI-based framework for building AI agents or generating content via command-line workflows. You can tweak the sections based on your exact implementation:

🧠 Agent Customization
Agents can be customized via YAML or JSON configs located in the templates/ folder. You can define:
- Personality traits
- Response style
- Model parameters
- Output format preferences

📦 Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI / HuggingFace APIs (optional)
- Rich (for CLI formatting)
- Typer or Click (for CLI command parsing)

🧪 Roadmap
- [ ] Add support for multi-agent collaboration
- [ ] Integrate with LangChain or AutoGen
- [ ] Add GUI wrapper for non-CLI users
- [ ] Enable voice-based agent interaction
